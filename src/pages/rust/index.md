## Rust

Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector, making it a useful language for a number of use cases other languages aren’t good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems. 

## Syntax
The syntax for Rust is similar in design to C and C++ and has syntax that is close to the ML family of languages. Rust has blocks of code delimited by curly brackets and has control flow keywords such as if, else, for, and while.
This syntax prints “Hello, world”
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
