## Lambda Expressions
A Lambda function is an anonymous inline function consisting of a single expression that is defined without a name. Regular functions are defined using the def keyword but this is defined using the lambda keyword. It is evaluated when the function is called. 

## Argument
The syntax to create a lambda function is 
```
python
lambda [arguments]: expression
```
