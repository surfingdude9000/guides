## Lambda Expressions

A Lambda function is an anonymous inline function consisting of a single expression that is defined without a name. Regular functions are defined using the def keyword but this is defined using the lambda keyword. It is evaluated when the function is called. 
The syntax to create a lambda function is 
```
python
lambda [arguments]: expression
```


<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
## Return Value
The lambda function returns an expression

## Sample Code
```
python
lambda x: x**4 + (x â€“ 1)
lambda x: x + 7
```
